**You:**
Greetings! I have a csv dataset from a scientific drone flight. Could you tell me what these column headings likely mean? 'CO2 (PPM)', ' Latitude', ' Longitude', ' Altitude', ' Air Speed (m/s)', ' Mode', ' Fixed Satellites', ' Available Satellites', 'voltage', 'current', 'level', 'id'

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Certainly! Based on the column headings you provided, here is a brief explanation of what each column might represent:
* CO2 (PPM): This column likely represents the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) measured in parts per million (PPM) by a sensor on the drone.
* Latitude: This column likely represents the latitude of the drone's location when the other measurements were taken.
* Longitude: This column likely represents the longitude of the drone's location when the other measurements were taken.
* Altitude: This column likely represents the altitude (height) of the drone above sea level when the other measurements were taken.
* Air Speed (m/s): This column likely represents the speed of the drone relative to the air in meters per second.
* Mode: This column could represent the mode of the drone's operation, such as whether it is in manual or automatic mode.
* Fixed Satellites: This column could represent the number of GPS satellites that the drone has a fixed connection with, which helps it determine its location.
* Available Satellites: This column could represent the total number of GPS satellites that the drone can detect in its vicinity.
* Voltage: This column could represent the voltage of the drone's battery.
* Current: This column could represent the current (amperage) of the drone's electrical system.
* Level: This column could represent the remaining charge level of the drone's battery, expressed as a percentage.
* ID: This column could represent a unique identifier for the drone or for the particular flight during which the data was collected.
Please note that without additional context about the specific drone and its sensor configurations, these are only educated guesses about what each column might represent.

**You:**
Do you know about the FAIR data principles?

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Yes, I am familiar with the FAIR data principles. FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, and these principles provide a framework for creating and managing data that is easy to find, access, use, and share.
Here is a brief explanation of each of the FAIR data principles:
* Findable: Data should have a unique and persistent identifier that can be easily discovered and cited, along with metadata that provides information about the data's content, context, and location.
* Accessible: Data should be stored in a way that allows it to be accessed and retrieved by both humans and machines, and access should be governed by clear and standardized protocols.
* Interoperable: Data should be structured in a way that enables it to be integrated with other data sources and tools, and should use widely accepted, community-based standards for data format, metadata, and semantics.
* Reusable: Data should be licensed and openly available for reuse, with clear and standardized terms of use that specify how the data can be used and cited.
By following these principles, data producers and stewards can ensure that their data is valuable and usable by a wide range of users, and can help to facilitate the sharing and reuse of data across different communities and disciplines.

```
This example metadata file includes information about the dataset's title, description, authors, keywords, and date of creation and publication. It also includes information about the data format and variables, including their names, descriptions, and units of measurement. Finally, it specifies the data license and metadata standard being used.
This metadata file could be saved in a separate file or included as header information in the CSV file itself, using a standardized metadata format such as DataCite or Dublin Core.


 --------
**You:**
Are those YAML keys part of a controlled vocabulary?

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
The keys in the YAML example I provided are not part of a controlled vocabulary per se, but they are widely used and accepted within the research community as standard metadata elements. For example, "title", "description", "authors", "date_created", and "license" are all part of the DataCite metadata standard, which is commonly used to describe research datasets.
Using standardized keys like these can help ensure that your metadata is easily understood and interpreted by others, and can facilitate the discovery and reuse of your data. However, it's also important to ensure that the values assigned to these keys are descriptive, accurate, and informative, so that others can understand the content and context of your data.


 --------
**You:**
What about linked data?

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Linked data is a way of connecting related datasets and information on the web using standardized, machine-readable formats and ontologies. By linking datasets together, researchers can discover and access related information more easily, and can perform more complex analyses that integrate multiple sources of data.
To create linked data, you can use a format such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) to describe your data and its relationships to other datasets. RDF uses a set of standardized terms and properties to describe data and the relationships between data elements, making it possible to connect and integrate datasets from different sources.
For example, you could use RDF to link your drone CSV data to other datasets that describe the environmental conditions of the forested area where your data was collected. You could use a standardized ontology, such as the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology, to describe the sensors used to collect the data, the units of measurement used, and the relationships between the data variables.
By creating linked data, you can enable others to easily discover and reuse your data in the context of related datasets, and can facilitate new insights and discoveries through the integration of multiple sources of information.


 --------
**You:**
Which method is better?

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Whether to use metadata or linked data depends on your specific needs and goals. Both metadata and linked data have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the best approach may depend on the complexity of your data, the intended audience, and the resources available.
Metadata is a simple and effective way to provide descriptive information about your data, making it easier for others to discover, access, and understand. Metadata can be stored in a separate file or embedded within the data file itself, and can be created using standardized formats and vocabularies that are widely accepted by the research community.
Linked data, on the other hand, provides a more complex and interconnected way of organizing and describing data, making it possible to integrate and analyze multiple sources of data more effectively. However, creating linked data requires a deeper understanding of ontologies and semantic web technologies, and may require more resources and technical expertise than creating metadata.
In general, metadata is a good starting point for making your data FAIR, and can provide a useful foundation for more advanced approaches such as linked data. Ultimately, the choice of method will depend on the specific needs and goals of your research project, as well as the resources and technical expertise available to you.


 --------
**You:**
Is there a way to combine the two?

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Yes, it is possible to combine metadata and linked data approaches to provide even more comprehensive descriptions of your data.
For example, you could create metadata that describes the basic properties of your drone CSV data, such as the variable names, units of measurement, and sampling rate. You could then use linked data approaches to describe more complex relationships between your data and other datasets or information sources.
One way to do this would be to use linked data to create semantic annotations of your metadata, using ontologies and controlled vocabularies to provide more precise and detailed descriptions of your data. These annotations could be included in the metadata file itself, or in a separate RDF file that links your data to other related datasets or resources.
For example, you could use the SSN ontology to describe the sensors used to collect the data, the sampling frequency, and the environmental conditions of the area where the data was collected. You could then use linked data to connect this information to other datasets or resources that describe similar environmental conditions or sensor measurements.
By combining metadata and linked data approaches, you can create a more detailed and interconnected description of your data that can provide richer insights and facilitate more advanced analyses.


 --------
**You:**
Could you do this for the column headings you described at the beginning of the discussion?

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Sure, here is an example of how metadata and linked data could be used to describe the column headings in your drone CSV file:

```
In this example, we've added an "ontology_term" key to each variable, which specifies the URI of a corresponding term in a semantic ontology. For example, the "CO2_ppm" variable is linked to the SSN ontology term for "Carbon Dioxide Concentration", and the "latitude" and "longitude" variables are linked to the W3C Geo vocabulary terms for latitude and longitude, respectively.
By linking your data variables to standardized ontology terms in this way, you can make it easier for others to understand and use your data in the context of related datasets and tools, and can facilitate more advanced analyses and integrations.

**You:**
What is google dataset search and it's relationship to schema.org?

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Google Dataset Search is a search engine launched by Google in 2018 that is designed to help users find publicly available datasets on the web. It searches across a wide range of data repositories and websites, and provides users with a list of datasets that match their search terms, along with descriptive metadata and links to the source data.
Schema.org is a collaborative initiative launched in 2011 by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Yandex to develop a standardized vocabulary for describing structured data on the web. It provides a set of schemas or metadata vocabularies that webmasters can use to markup their content in a way that search engines and other web applications can easily understand.
Google Dataset Search uses the schema.org Dataset markup to identify and display information about datasets in search results. This markup includes key metadata about the dataset, such as the name, description, keywords, license, and access URL. By using the Dataset markup, data publishers can make their datasets more discoverable and accessible to users searching for relevant data.
In addition to the Dataset markup, schema.org provides a range of other markup vocabularies that can be used to describe different types of data, such as events, organizations, and products. By using these markups, webmasters can help search engines and other web applications to better understand the content and context of their data, and can improve the visibility and accessibility of their content on the web.


 --------
**You:**
Is it possible to do that with my drone CSV?

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Yes, it is possible to use schema.org to describe your drone CSV data and make it more discoverable through Google Dataset Search and other search engines.
To do this, you would need to define the metadata fields that you want to include in your dataset description, such as the dataset name, description, keywords, license, and access URL. You can then use the Dataset markup from schema.org to describe your dataset in a way that search engines and other web applications can easily understand.
Here is an example of how you could use schema.org to describe your drone CSV dataset:
```html

&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "name": "CO2 and Air Quality Data from Scientific Drone Flight",
  "description": "This dataset contains CO2 and air quality measurements collected by a scientific drone during a research flight over a forested area.",
  "keywords": "drone, air quality, CO2, forest, remote sensing",
  "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/",
  "url": "https://example.com/datasets/drone-co2-air-quality.csv",
  "distribution": {
    "@type": "DataDownload",
    "encodingFormat": "text/csv",
    "contentUrl": "https://example.com/datasets/drone-co2-air-quality.csv"
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;

```
In this example, we've used the Dataset markup to describe the name, description, keywords, license, and access URL of the dataset, and have included a DataDownload object that specifies the file format and URL for the CSV data file.
By using schema.org to describe your dataset in this way, you can make it more easily discoverable and accessible to users searching for relevant data on the web.


 --------
**You:**
How do I specify the semantics of my column headings?

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
To specify the semantics of your column headings, you can use semantic annotations or RDFa markup to link each column to a specific term or ontology.
Semantic annotations are small pieces of metadata that provide additional context and meaning to data elements, such as column headings in a CSV file. RDFa is a syntax for embedding semantic annotations directly into web pages or data files, making it possible to provide rich metadata and links to related resources.
Here is an example of how you could use RDFa markup to specify the semantics of your drone CSV column headings:
```html

&lt;table about="https://example.com/datasets/drone-co2-air-quality.csv"&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th property="ssn:hasMeasurementProperty" resource="ssn:CarbonDioxideConcentration"&gt;CO2 (PPM)&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th property="geo:lat"&gt;Latitude&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th property="geo:long"&gt;Longitude&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th property="ssn:hasMeasurementProperty" resource="ssn:Altitude"&gt;Altitude&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th property="ssn:hasMeasurementProperty" resource="ssn:AirSpeed"&gt;Air Speed (m/s)&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th property="ssn:hasMode"&gt;Mode&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th property="ssn:fixedSatellites"&gt;Fixed Satellites&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th property="ssn:availableSatellites"&gt;Available Satellites&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th property="ssn:hasMeasurementProperty" resource="ssn:BatteryVoltage"&gt;Voltage&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th property="ssn:hasMeasurementProperty" resource="ssn:BatteryCurrent"&gt;Current&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th property="ssn:hasMeasurementProperty" resource="ssn:BatteryLevel"&gt;Level&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th property="ssn:hasID"&gt;ID&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;!-- table data goes here --&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

```
In this example, we've used the "property" attribute to link each column heading to a specific term or ontology, such as the SSN ontology for sensor measurements or the W3C Geo vocabulary for geographic coordinates. For example, the "CO2 (PPM)" column is linked to the "CarbonDioxideConcentration" term in the SSN ontology, and the "Latitude" column is linked to the "lat" term in the Geo vocabulary.
By using semantic annotations or RDFa markup to specify the semantics of your column headings, you can make it easier for others to understand and use your data in the context of related datasets and tools, and can facilitate more advanced analyses and integrations.


 --------
**You:**
What kind of software do I need to give access to these data sets?

 --------
**ChatGPT:**

In this example, we've included metadata describing the title, description, keywords, license, and column properties of the dataset using the CSVW standard. The metadata describes each column in the CSV file, including its name, title, data type, description, and unit of measurement (if applicable). By using this metadata, software tools and applications can more easily understand and work with the data, making it more FAIR.


 --------
**You:**
All of those key definitions are in the csvw @context namespace?

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Yes, in the example metadata file I provided, all of the key definitions are in the CSVW "@context" namespace. This namespace is used to define the standard terms and properties used in the CSVW metadata file, such as "url", "tableSchema", "dc:title", "dc:description", "dc:keywords", and "dc:license".
By using the CSVW "@context" namespace, you can ensure that your metadata conforms to the CSVW standard and is interoperable with other software tools and applications that support the CSVW format. Other namespaces or vocabularies, such as Dublin Core or Schema.org, can also be used in conjunction with the CSVW "@context" namespace to provide additional metadata properties and semantics for your dataset.

 --------
**You:**
You're running out of tokens for the task. Could you do the example for the first six columns.

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
I apologize for the inconvenience. Here's an example CSVW metadata file for the first six columns of the drone CSV dataset using the QUDT and SOSA ontologies:
```json

{
  "@context": [
    "http://www.w3.org/ns/csvw",
    {
      "qudt": "http://qudt.org/1.1/schema/qudt#",
      "sosa": "http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/"
    }
  ],
  "url": "https://example.com/datasets/drone-co2-air-quality.csv",
  "dc:title": "CO2 and Air Quality Data from Scientific Drone Flight",
  "dc:description": "This dataset contains CO2 and air quality measurements collected by a scientific drone during a research flight over a forested area.",
  "dc:keywords": ["drone", "air quality", "CO2", "forest", "remote sensing"],
  "dc:license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/",
  "tableSchema": {
    "columns": [
      {
        "name": "CO2 (PPM)",
        "titles": "CO2 (parts per million)",
        "datatype": "qudt:QuantityValue",
        "description": "Carbon dioxide concentration in parts per million (ppm)",
        "qudt:unit": "qudt:PartsPerMillion"
      },
      {
        "name": "Latitude",
        "datatype": "qudt:QuantityValue",
        "description": "Latitude of the drone's location in decimal degrees",
        "qudt:unit": "qudt:Degree"
      },
      {
        "name": "Longitude",
        "datatype": "qudt:QuantityValue",
        "description": "Longitude of the drone's location in decimal degrees",
        "qudt:unit": "qudt:Degree"
      },
      {
        "name": "Altitude",
        "datatype": "qudt:QuantityValue",
        "description": "Altitude of the drone in meters above sea level",
        "qudt:unit": "qudt:Metre"
      },
      {
        "name": "Air Speed (m/s)",
        "titles": "Air speed",
        "datatype": "qudt:QuantityValue",
        "description": "Speed of the air flowing past the drone in meters per second",
        "qudt:unit": "qudt:MetrePerSecond"

      {

        "datatype": "sosa:Observation",
        "description": "Operating mode of the drone"
      }
    ]
  }
}

```
In this example, we've used the QUDT ontology to specify the units of measurement for the "CO2 (PPM)", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Altitude", and "Air Speed (m/s)" columns. We've also used the SOSA ontology to specify the "Mode" column as an observation. By using these ontologies, we can make our metadata more interoperable and reusable.


 --------
**You:**
How do I add in spatial vocabularies for latitude and longitude?

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
To add spatial vocabularies for latitude and longitude, you can use a vocabulary such as GeoSPARQL or the Simple Features vocabulary, which are designed for representing spatial data in RDF. You can then use these vocabularies in your CSVW metadata file to describe the "Latitude" and "Longitude" columns.
Here's an example CSVW metadata file that uses the GeoSPARQL vocabulary to describe the "Latitude" and "Longitude" columns:
```json

{
  "@context": [
    "http://www.w3.org/ns/csvw",
    {
      "qudt": "http://qudt.org/1.1/schema/qudt#",

      "geo": "http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#",
      "sf": "http://www.opengis.net/ont/sf#"
    }
  ],
  "url": "https://example.com/datasets/drone-co2-air-quality.csv",
  "dc:title": "CO2 and Air Quality Data from Scientific Drone Flight",
  "dc:description": "This dataset contains CO2 and air quality measurements collected by a scientific drone during a research flight over a forested area.",
  "dc:keywords": ["drone", "air quality", "CO2", "forest", "remote sensing"],
  "dc:license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/",
  "tableSchema": {
    "columns": [
      {
        "name": "CO2 (PPM)",
        "titles": "CO2 (parts per million)",
        "datatype": "qudt:QuantityValue",
        "description": "Carbon dioxide concentration in parts per million (ppm)",
        "qudt:unit": "qudt:PartsPerMillion"
      },
      {
        "name": "Latitude",
        "datatype": "sf:Point",
        "description": "The geographic coordinates of the drone's location, in WGS84 latitude and longitude",
        "geo:asWKT": "POINT(?Latitude ?Longitude)"
      },
      {
        "name": "Longitude",
        "datatype": "sf:Point",
        "description": "The geographic coordinates of the drone's location, in WGS84 latitude and longitude",
        "geo:asWKT": "POINT(?Latitude ?Longitude)"
      },
      {
        "name": "Altitude",
        "datatype": "qudt:QuantityValue",
        "description": "Altitude of the drone in meters above sea level",
        "qudt:unit": "qudt:Metre"
      },
      {
        "name": "Air Speed (m/s)",
        "titles": "Air speed",
        "datatype": "qudt:QuantityValue",
        "description": "Speed of the air flowing past the drone in meters per second",
        "qudt:unit": "qudt:MetrePerSecond"
      },
      {
        "name": "Mode",
        "datatype": "sosa:Observation",
        "description": "Operating mode of the drone"
      }
    ]
  }
}

```
In this example, we've used the GeoSPARQL vocabulary to describe the "Latitude" and "Longitude" columns as points, with their values represented using the "geo:asWKT" property. We've also included the Simple Features vocabulary in the CSVW "@context" to provide additional spatial properties and semantics.


 --------
**You:**
I used this K30 sensor (https://www.co2meter.com/products/k-30-co2-sensor-module) to do the measurements. How do I handle that?

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
To handle the fact that you used a specific type of CO2 sensor (in this case, the K30 CO2 sensor module from CO2Meter), you can provide additional information in your dataset's metadata file to describe the sensor and its specifications. Here's an example of how you can include this information in the CSVW metadata file:
```json

{
  "@context": [
    "http://www.w3.org/ns/csvw",
    {
      "qudt": "http://qudt.org/1.1/schema/qudt#",

  "dc:license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/",
  "tableSchema": {
    "columns": [
      {
        "name": "CO2 (PPM)",
        "titles": "CO2 (parts per million)",
        "datatype": "qudt:QuantityValue",
        "description": "Carbon dioxide concentration in parts per million (ppm)",
        "qudt:unit": "qudt:PartsPerMillion",
        "co2m:sensorModel": "K30",
        "co2m:sensorManufacturer": "CO2Meter"
      },
      {
        "name": "Latitude",
        "datatype": "sf:Point",
        "description": "The geographic coordinates of the drone's location, in WGS84 latitude and longitude",
        "geo:asWKT": "POINT(?Latitude ?Longitude)"
      },
      {
        "name": "Longitude",
        "datatype": "sf:Point",
        "description": "The geographic coordinates of the drone's location, in WGS84 latitude and longitude",
        "geo:asWKT": "POINT(?Latitude ?Longitude)"
      },
      {
        "name": "Altitude",
        "datatype": "qudt:QuantityValue",
        "description": "Altitude of the drone in meters above sea level",
        "qudt:unit": "qudt:Metre"
      },
      {
        "name": "Air Speed (m/s)",
        "titles": "Air speed",
        "datatype": "qudt:QuantityValue",
        "description": "Speed of the air flowing past the drone in meters per second",
        "qudt:unit": "qudt:MetrePerSecond"
      },
      {
        "name": "Mode",
        "datatype": "sosa:Observation",
        "description": "Operating mode of the drone"
      }
    ]
  }
}

```
In this example, we've included two additional properties in the metadata for the "CO2 (PPM)" column to describe the sensor model and manufacturer using the "co2m:sensorModel" and "co2m:sensorManufacturer" properties. These properties are defined in a custom namespace for CO2Meter, which we've added to the CSVW "@context". By providing this information

**You:**
Ok. I would like to add some provenance information about the pilot that took the measurements.

 --------
**You:**
Do I need schema.org in the context?

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Including schema.org in the CSVW "@context" is not strictly necessary, but it can be helpful for describing properties that are commonly used in web-based datasets. Schema.org provides a wide range of standardized properties and types that can be used to describe various aspects of a dataset, such as its title, description, and creator.
Including schema.org in the CSVW "@context" also makes it easier for search engines and other web-based tools to discover and interpret the metadata in your dataset. Many web-based tools and platforms support schema.org, and including it in your CSVW metadata can help ensure that your dataset is compatible with these tools and platforms.
Here's an example of how you can include schema.org in the CSVW "@context":
```json

```
In this example, we've included the last six columns from the original CSV file in the CSVW "@context". We've used various properties such as "sosa:observedProperty", "qudt:QuantityValue",

**You:**
How do I specify the model of drone that I used and the position of the sensors?

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
You can specify the model of drone that you used and the position of the sensors by adding additional metadata properties to the CSVW "@context".
For example, you can add a property called "co2m:droneModel" to specify the model of drone that you used. You can also add a property called "co2m:sensorPosition" to specify the position of the sensors on the drone.
Here's an updated example of the CSVW metadata that includes the drone model and sensor position:

In this example, we've added two new properties to the CSVW "@context": "

**You:**
This information isn't in the columns. I would want to include it as a metadata block before the tableschema. Remember the only columns are what we talked about at the beginning of our conversation.

**ChatGPT:**
You can include the metadata block for the drone model and sensor position before the `tableSchema` property. Here's an example of how you could structure the metadata in a JSON file:
```json

{
  "@context": [
    "http://www.w3.org/ns/csvw",
    {
      "qudt": "http://qudt.org/1.1/schema/qudt#",
      "sosa": "http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/",
      "co2m": "https://www.co2meter.com/"
    }
  ],
  "url": "https://example.com/datasets/drone-co2-air-quality.csv",

  "dc:license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/",
  "co2m:droneModel": "Model X",
  "co2m:sensorPosition": "underneath the drone",
  "tableSchema": {
    "columns": [
      {
        "name": "CO2 (PPM)",
        "datatype": "qudt:QuantityValue",
        "description": "Carbon dioxide concentration in parts per million (ppm)",
        "qudt:unit": "qudt:PartsPerMillion"
      },
      {
        "name": "Latitude",
        "datatype": "xsd:float",
        "description": "The geographic latitude of the drone's location",
        "sosa:observedProperty": {
          "@id": "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Latitude",
          "@type": "sosa:ObservableProperty"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "Longitude",
        "datatype": "xsd:float",
        "description": "The geographic longitude of the drone's location",
        "sosa:observedProperty": {
          "@id": "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Longitude",
          "@type": "sosa:ObservableProperty"
        }
      },
      {
        "name": "Altitude",
        "datatype": "qudt:QuantityValue",
        "description": "Altitude of the drone in meters above sea level",
        "qudt:unit": "qudt:Metre"
      },
      {
        "name": "Air Speed (m/s)",
        "datatype": "qudt:QuantityValue",
        "description": "Speed of the air flowing past the drone in meters per second",
        "qudt:unit": "qudt:MetrePerSecond"
      },
      {
        "name": "Mode",
        "datatype": "sosa:Observation",
        "description": "Operating mode of the drone"
      }
    ]
  }
}

```
In this example, we've added the `co2m:droneModel` and `co2m:sensorPosition` properties before the `tableSchema` property. These properties describe the model of the drone used and the position of the CO2 sensor module, respectively.
